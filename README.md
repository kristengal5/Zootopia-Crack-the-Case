# Zootopia-Crack-the-Case
I created this game in my Java Programming class as a junior. 
I coded this game in BlueJ. 
Students were able to create a game with almost complete freedom, and I chose to create a game based on the Disney movie Zootopia. 
Some of the coding approaches I used include loops and nested loops, multiple classes, arrays, and random numbers. 
In my game, there are multiple worlds and mini challenges. 
Players must pick up and drop items, talk to characters, and solve the missing mammal case. 
One problem I encountered was ensuring that a player cannot advance to the next world without completing the mini challenge. 
To solve this, I implemented multiple checks with conditional statements and used booleans to keep track of a player's moves.
